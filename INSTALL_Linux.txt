------------
Requirements
------------

* C++11-enabled compiler
  has been tested successfully with g++ 4.6 and g++ 4.7
* OpenCL 1.1+
  only has to be installed on the dOpenCL compute nodes.
  The OpenCL headers and C++ binding have to be installed in the system's
  default include directories
* Boost (>=1.41.0)
  required libraries: Boost.Asio, Boost.Program_options, Boost.Test (optional)
  http://www.boost.org
* CMake (>=2.6)
  http://www.cmake.org

Building dOpenCL from source
----------------------------

1. Create dOpenCL home

   Create a directory and copy the dOpenCL sources into that directory.
   This directory will become the dOpenCL home.

2. Build dOpenCL

   dOpenCL is build in two steps: after creating a Make file using CMake, the
   dOpenCL binaries and libraries are build using Make.

   a) Creating the make file using CMake
      The dOpenCL CMake configuration (CMakeLists.txt in dOpenCL home) allows
      for the following settings:

	FORCE_FLUSH=OFF       flush command queues after enqueing a command
            This option can be set to increase concurrency of command execution
            in OpenCL implementations that do not execute command before a
            command queue is flushed (e.g., AMD APP SDK)
        BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON 
            build dOpenCL communication library as shared object (recommended)
            Note that the dOpenCL installable client driver (libdOpenCL.so) is
            always built as a shared object.

      Besides, the CMake build type (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE) has to be specified.
      We recommend using the ncurses CMake GUI 'ccmake'.

      We strongly recommend to perform an out-of-source build: create a
      directory for building dOpenCL and change into that directory. For
      example, create a subdirectory 'build' inside the dOpenCL home.

   b) Build dOpenCL binaries and libraries using Make
      After creating the make file with CMake, the dOpenCL binaries and
      libraries can be built by calling 'make' in the build directory.

   The corresponding commands for building dOpenCL are as follows:
     cd <dOpenCL home>
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     make


------------------
Installing dOpenCL
------------------

dOpenCL is most easily installed by calling 'make install' from within the build
directory. This will install dOpenCL in your system's default directory. Note
that the call requires root rights.

If you do not want to install dOpenCL into your default system directory, or if
you do not have appropriate rights to do so, you should export the DCL_HOME
environment variable, such that its value is the path to the dOpenCL build
directory.

After installing dOpenCL, refer to README_Linux.txt for information on how to
use dOpenCL.

Installable Client Driver (ICD)
-------------------------------

dOpenCL currently does not support OpenCL's ICD loader mechanism. Hence, either
the system's ICD loader (<system library directory>/libOpenCL.so) has to be
replaced by dOpenCL's ICD (libdOpenCL.so), or the dOpenCL ICD has to be added to
the list of preloaded libraries in the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.


------------
Known issues
------------

* GNU C++ linker: undefined reference to `pthread_*'

Although dOpenCL does not use POSIX threads directly (but C++11 threads)
compilers may use POSIX threads to implement C++11 threads. This is the case for
the GNU C++ compiler, which requires the '-pthread' compiler option in order to
compile dOpenCL. This option can be set using the CMAKE_CXXFLAGS setting in CMake.

* CMake: Boost_DIR always is set to Boost_DIR-NOTFOUND

This is a known bug of the FindBoost CMake module (see
http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=13453). The problem can be ignored as
CMake stills correctly finds the Boost directory (if Boost is installed).
